# Trimester 2 Reflection

In trimester 2 for Computer Science Projects, I did many things. I built the operating system called [BlueLightOS](https://bluelightos.js.org), I started designing a Z80 powered computer, and started learning the programming language called Rust. BlueLightOS started out small but has become a successful project, in my opinion the project is the best one. It shows multiple skills being used like debugging, writing scripts, and partitioning. BlueLightOS also required some communication skills because I had to talk to other developers to help fix some bugs. If I continue developing BlueLightOS, then it may be a more complete operating system and may compete with other operating systems. The Z80 computer was more hardware focused, I learned how 8 and 16 bit busses work and voltages. Harrison showed me a program called Fritzing, it has breadboard, PCB, and schematic design. The Rust programming language has shown me a new way to write code. I'll be able to write may web applications and desktop applications using Rust. Rust is similar to a language called Haskwell so I'm interested in that language as well.
