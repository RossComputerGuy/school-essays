	Around the time the book "The Great Gatsby" was written there was a problem with the rich and poor having a major gap. Even in
	today's times there are more homeless people than there ever has been according to Jason Conger at politifact.com. The richer getting richer and poor getting poorer is a true statement too. Many people have financial problems and most Americans are in debt. In the book, the author portrays very rich people as extravogent and like to spend money like Jay Gatsby.

	Jay Gatsby's extravogance with money is shown by him spending tons of money on things that he most likely doesn't need. The rich likes to spend money on tons of things while looking like a good person. Rich people donate to organizations and charities because it makes them look good. Spending money on good things is just a publicity thing decieving the public into thinking the rich are great people. While this happens, poor people can't flatter their money or has not enough money for food.

	Poor people cannot afford to be spending their money on big things like mansions or even to move a lot in a year. Some poor people cannot even afford to pay for things like heat, power, and plumming. These people eventually could become homeless which then they have to live in the streets because they couldn't afford a house. After some time, a homeless person will die and their corpse will be in the streets. If this cannot be fixed then more deaths of homeless people will occur.

	When tax prices are lowered, it fixes some of the issues for poor people since they wouldn't have to spend as much money. However, people are greedy and as long as rich people are in control, they'll keep the taxes as high as they can without seeming suspicous or bad. If enough people complain, then the tax prices could lower but that depends on many things like who's controlling the taxes.

	In the end, the poor will keep getting poorer and the rich will keep getting richer. Under the current legal system of the United States and many other contries, this enless cycle of people getting poor and rich people getting more money will occur.
